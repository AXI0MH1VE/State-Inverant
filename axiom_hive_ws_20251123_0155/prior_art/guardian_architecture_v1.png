# Guardian Architecture Diagram v1.0

This is a placeholder for the PNG diagram. The actual diagram would show:

## Visual Representation

```
[User] --> [API Gateway] --> [Guardian Legal] --> [Guardian Safety] --> [Guardian Audit] --> [Drone Fleet]
                           |                    |                      |
                           v                    v                      v
                      [ASL-1.0 Check]     [Toxicity Scan]       [QLDB Write]
                      [PII Detection]     [Injection Check]     [Immutable Log]
                      [IP Contamination]  [Bias Analysis]       [Crypto Hash]
```

## Key Components

1. **API Gateway (Service-Gateway)**: Entry point, authentication, rate limiting
2. **Guardian Legal**: Scans for legal violations, PII, IP issues
3. **Guardian Safety**: Scans for safety issues, toxicity, adversarial attacks
4. **Guardian Audit**: Writes entire transaction to immutable ledger
5. **Drone Fleet**: Isolated AI models with no external access

## Data Flow

1. User request enters via Gateway
2. Gateway routes to Guardian Legal for compliance check
3. If compliant, passes to Guardian Safety for security check
4. If safe, routes to Drone for inference
5. Response goes back through Safety check
6. Entire lifecycle logged to QLDB by Guardian Audit
7. Auditable response returned to user

## Security Boundaries

- Guardians have zero external network access
- Drones can only communicate with Guardians
- All inter-service communication via gRPC with contracts
- Immutable audit trail prevents tampering
