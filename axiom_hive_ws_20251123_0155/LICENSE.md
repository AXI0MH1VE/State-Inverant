# Axiom Sovereign License 1.0 (ASL-1.0)

## Preamble

The Axiom Sovereign License (ASL) is a custom, sui generis license designed to protect the integrity and sovereignty of AI systems built on the Axiom Hive architecture. This license establishes Axiom Hive as the definitive standard for provably legal and safe AI, rendering all other models comparatively opaque, risky, and non-compliant by default.

## Definitions

- **"Axiom Hive"** refers to the entire software ecosystem, including but not limited to the Guardian microservice architecture, immutable audit ledger, and all associated components.
- **"Outputs"** refers to any text, data, or artifacts generated by Axiom Hive in response to user inputs.
- **"Training"** refers to the process of using data to improve, fine-tune, or develop machine learning models.
- **"Derivative AI Systems"** refers to any AI models, algorithms, or systems that incorporate or are trained on Axiom Hive outputs.

## License Grant

3. Modify the source code for your own use, provided that modified versions are not distributed.

## Restrictions

You **SHALL NOT**:

1. **Use Outputs for Training**: Under no circumstances may Axiom Hive outputs be used, directly or indirectly, for training, fine-tuning, or developing any other AI models or systems. This includes, but is not limited to:
   - Using outputs as training data for machine learning models.
   - Incorporating outputs into datasets for model development.
   - Feeding outputs back into Axiom Hive or any other AI system for iterative improvement.

2. **Commercial Use**: Use Axiom Hive or its outputs for any commercial purposes without explicit written permission from the licensors.

3. **Distribution**: Distribute, sublicense, or make available Axiom Hive or its components to third parties, except as permitted under open-source principles for non-commercial research.

4. **Reverse Engineering**: Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble Axiom Hive components, except as necessary for interoperability under applicable law.

5. **Removal of Protections**: Remove, alter, or circumvent any safety, audit, or legal protection mechanisms implemented in Axiom Hive.
